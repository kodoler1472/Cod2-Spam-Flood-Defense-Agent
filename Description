Title: CoD2 Connection Sanitizer & Flood Defense Agent

Description:

This tool is a silent background agent designed to defend against unauthorized or spoofed player connection attempts targeting Call of Duty 2 servers. It specifically identifies and mitigates fake clients that use crafted getchallenge and connect packets to simulate real players, often used in server flooding or disruption attacks.

Key capabilities include:

Protocol-Level Inspection: Monitors UDP traffic on known CoD2 server ports and analyzes incoming getchallenge and connect sequences to determine authenticity.

Rate-Limiting Engine: Automatically delays or drops excessive or malformed requests that mimic legitimate player behavior but occur at unnatural speeds or in high volumes.

Spoof Detection: Flags connections that use randomized GUIDs, fake hardware strings, or abnormal name patterns (e.g., mass connection from @flooded_user# bots).

Registry & Process Monitoring: Detects unauthorized persistence mechanisms often used by malicious executables (such as self-copying to %APPDATA% and writing to the Run registry key), and removes or quarantines them safely.

Server Integrity Mode: Optionally integrates with the server to enforce a challenge-response verification before allowing player join events, ensuring only proper clients are processed.

This agent is ideal for administrators running public or private CoD2 servers who want to maintain stable uptime, minimize spoofed players, and prevent UDP-level flooding without affecting real clients.
